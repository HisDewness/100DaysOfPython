# Interactive Exercise #1 Problem
# Write a program in main.py that prints the same 
# notes from the previous lesson using what you have 
# learnt about the Python print function.

# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

# Interactive Exercise #2 Problem: Debugging Practice
# Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There 
# are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so 
# that it runs without errors.

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the " '"+"'  + " sign.")
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")');
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
